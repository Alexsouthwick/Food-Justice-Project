        <p> My argument centers around the correlation between lack of accessibility to healthy food through location and price in low-income neighborhoods and diabetes. I chose to focus on Hunters Point because it is a low-income neighborhood with a high population of people with diabetes, as shown in the charts below. </p>

 <h2> Type 2 Diabetes </h2>
 <div class= "diabetes" id="image">

<p id= "wrap"> Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the body does not use insulin properly, a hormone that delivers the glucose from the bloodstream into most cells of the body to create energy- this is called insulin resistance. When glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into cells it can starve the cells of energy and over time it can hurt the eyes, kidneys, nerves, or heart. Lifestyle causes of type 2 diabetes include weight, fat distribution, and inactivity; therefore eating unhealthily and not exercising can contribute to type 2 diabetes. According to Harvard School of Public Health, people who consume sugary drinks regularly- 1 to 2 cans a day or more- have a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>

 <h2> Data </h2>
 <div class= "paragraph"> 
<p> To begin gathering data, I drove around the residential area of Hunters Point to see how accessible produce and healthy food were. A food desert is a neighborhood that does not have any grocery stores or places to buy food; that is what I found at Hunters Point. I only found one store in the area- a liquor store that sold alcohol, soda, and other things that do not qualify as groceries. The nearest grocery store that I could find was 1.3 miles away at Super Save Market. Although it is small, this market does have all of the things one would expect to find in a grocery store: fruit, dairy, bread etc. Here are the data I collected that compares the prices of Super Save to Safeway:</p>

<div class= "paragraph"> 
<p> As is shown in the table above, everything in Super Save Market was more expensive than in Safeway except soda. Because Super Save is the only grocery store within miles, residents of Hunters Point are forced to shop there, paying more for all of their groceries. The only product that is priced the same no matter where is it bought is soda. Also the fact that the liquor store is almost a mile closer to the residential area means that it is easier and cheaper to buy alcohol and soda than to buy healthy food; this is one of the main contributors to the amount of people who have diabetes in Hunters Point.</p>
