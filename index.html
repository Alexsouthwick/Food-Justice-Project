        <p> My argument centers around the correlation between lack of accessiblity to healthy food through location and price in low-income neighborhoods and diabetes. I chose to focus on Hunters Point because it is a low-income neighborhood with a high population of people with diabetes, as shown in the charts below. </p>

 <h2> Data </h2>
 <div class= "paragraph"> 
<p> To begin gathering data, I drove around the residential area of Hunters Point to see how accessible produce and healthy food were. The reason I call Hunters Point a food desert is that while driving through the neighborhood, I did not see any stores at all. I only found one liquor store that sold alcohol, soda, and other things that do not qualify as groceries. The nearest grocery store that I could find was 1.3 miles away at Super Saver Market. Although it is small, this market does have all of the things one would expect to find in a grocery store: fruit, dairy, bread etc. Here is the data I collected that compares the prices of Super Saver to Safeway:</p>

<p> As is shown in the table above, everything in Super Saver Market was more expensive than in Safeway except soda.</p>
