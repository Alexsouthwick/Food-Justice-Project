        <p> A “food desert” is a residential area with a lack of access to healthy food both in terms of location and price.  I investigated the hypothesis that there is a correlation between living in a food desert and increased rates of diabetes. I chose to focus on the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood as a low-income neighborhood with a high population of people with diabetes. </p>

 <h2> Type 2 Diabetes </h2>

<p id= "wrap"> Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. With  Type 2 Diabetes, the body does not use insulin properly; this is called insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that delivers glucose from the bloodstream into most cells of the body to create energy. When glucose builds up in the blood it can starve the cells of energy and, over time, it can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and/or heart. Lifestyle choices connected to Type 2 Diabetes include: excess weight, fat distribution, and inactivity, so not eating healthily and not exercising can contribute to Type 2 Diabetes. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, people who consume sugary drinks regularly - 1 to 2 cans a day or more - have a 26% greater risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes than those who do not consume sugary drinks regularly.

 <h2> Data </h2>
 <div class= "paragraph"> 
<p> For the field data collection portion of my study, I drove around the Bayview Hunters Point to assess  how accessible fresh produce and healthy food were to the residents of the area.  I only found one store in the area - a liquor store that sold alcohol, soda, and other foods that do not qualify as groceries. The nearest grocery store that I located, Super Save Market,  was 1.3 miles from the main residential area. </p>

</div>
    <p>Although small, the Super Save Market has  all the products usually found in a grocery store: fruit, dairy, bread etc. Here are the data I collected that compares the prices of Super Save to Safeway:</p>

</div>
<div class= "paragraph"> 
<p> As is shown in the table above, everything in Super Saver Market was more expensive than in the Safeway I visited at 16th and Mission Streets except soda. Because Super Saver is the only grocery store within a reasonable distance, residents of Hunters Point are forced to shop there, paying more for all of their groceries than if they lived in a more affluent neighborhood. The only product that is priced the same no matter where is it bought is soda. Since the liquor store is almost a mile closer to the residential area,  it is easier and cheaper to buy alcohol and soda than to buy healthy food. It is reasonable to assume therefore that easy access to unhealthy foods (e.g. soda) and poor access to healthy foods (cost and location) is a significant contributor to the high rates of Type 2 Diabetes in Bayview Hunters Point and that this area can be considered a Food Desert.
